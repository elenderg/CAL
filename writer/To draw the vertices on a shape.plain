To draw the vertices on an shape:
  If the shape is nil, exit.
  If the shape's kind is not "polygon", exit.
  Loop.
  Get an vertex from the shape's polygon's vertices.
  If the vertex is nil, exit.
  Draw the vertex.
  If the vertex is the shape's polygon's vertices' last, draw the vertex's spot with the black color.
  Repeat.

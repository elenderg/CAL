To blurt an variable into an buffer:
  If the variable's compiled flag is not set, exit.
  If the variable's type can be reduced to "string", blurt the variable into the buffer (as an string); exit.
  Put the variable's address minus the image base into an address.
  Blurt the variable's data into the buffer at the address.

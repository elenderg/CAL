To load an source file:
  If the source file is nil, exit.
  Load the source file's path into the source file's buffer.
  If the i/o error is not blank, abort with "Could not load the file named '" then the source file's path then "'."; exit.
  
  
To load some source files:
  Loop.
    If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
    Get an item from the compiler's directory.
    If the item is not found, break.
    If the item's kind is not "file", repeat.
    If the item's extension is not blank, repeat.
    If the item looks reamish, repeat.
    Add an source file to the source files given the item's path.
    Load the source file.
  Repeat.

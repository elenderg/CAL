To calculate the length of an type:
  If the type is nil, exit.
  If the type's length is not -1, exit.
  Calculate the length of the type's base type.
  If the type's fields are empty, put the type's base type's length into the type's length; exit.
  Put 0 into the type's length.
  Loop.
    If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
    Get an field from the type's fields.
    If the field is nil, exit.
    If the field's redefinition target name is not blank, repeat.
    Calculate the length of the field's type.
    Add the field's type's length times the field's count to the type's length.
  Repeat.
  
  
To calculate the lengths of some types:
    If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
    Get an type from the types.
    If the type is nil, exit.
    Calculate the length of the type.
  Repeat.
  
  
To calculate the offsets in an type:
  If the type is nil, exit.
  Put 0 into an offset.
  Loop.
    If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
    Get an field from the type's fields.
    If the field is nil, exit.
    If the field's redefinition target name is not blank, repeat.
    Put the offset into the field's offset.
    Add the field's type's length times the field's count to the offset.
  Repeat.
  
  
To calculate the offsets in some types:
    If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
    Get an type from the types.
    If the type is nil, exit.
    Calculate the offsets in the type.
  Repeat.
  
  
To calculate the redefinition offsets in an type:
  If the type is nil, exit.
  Loop.
    If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
    Get an field from the type's fields.
    If the field is nil, exit.
    If the field's redefinition target name is blank, repeat.
    Find another field given the field's redefinition target name and the type's fields.
    If the other field is nil, abort with "Invalid redefine. I can't find the '" then the field's redefinition target name then "' field." and the field's locus; exit.
    Put the other field's offset into the field's offset.
  Repeat.
  
  
To calculate the redefinition offsets in some types:
    If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
    Get an type from the types.
    If the type is nil, exit.
    Calculate the redefinition offsets in the type.
  Repeat.

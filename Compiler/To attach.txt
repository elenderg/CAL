To attach address loading code to an hex string given an variable: \ loads into edx
  If the variable is nil, attach $C7C200000000 to the hex string; exit. \ mov edx,0
  If the variable's kind is "global", attach $C7C2 and the variable's address to the hex string; exit. \ mov edx,the variable's address
  If the variable's kind is "literal", attach $C7C2 and the variable's address to the hex string; exit. \ mov edx,the variable's address
  If the variable's kind is "local", attach $8D95 and the variable's offset to the hex string; exit. \ lea edx,[ebp+the variable's offset]
  If the variable's kind is "scratch", attach $8B95 and the variable's offset to the hex string; exit. \ mov edx,[ebp+the variable's offset]
  If the variable's kind is not "parameter", abort with "Internal error - attach address loading code to an hex string given an variable"; exit.
  If the variable's by-value flag is set, attach $8D95 and the variable's offset to the hex string; exit. \ lea edx,[ebp+the variable's offset]
  Attach $8B95 and the variable's offset to the hex string. \ mov edx,[ebp+the variable's offset]
  
  
To attach an hex string and an address to an fragment: \ call or jump
  Put the address into an number.
  Subtract the fragment's address from the number.
  Subtract the fragment's code's length from the number.
  Subtract the hex string's length from the number.
  Subtract 4 from the number.
  Attach the hex string and the number to the fragment's code.

  Repeat.
  
  
To find given an page and an flag (shapes):
  Clear the flag.
  If the page is nil, exit.
  Put the page's shape refers' first into an shape refer.
  If the page is not the find page, put 1 and 1 into the find anchor.
  If the page is the find page, find the shape refer given the page's shape refers and the find shape.
  Loop.
    If the shape refer is nil, exit.
    Find next given the shape refer's shape's text and the flag.
    If the flag is set, begin edit on the page given the shape refer's shape; exit.

To decide if the edge of an page is visible in an document:
  If the page is nil, say no.
  Put the page's edge into an box.
  Globalize the box given the document's origin.
  If the box's top is less than the document's top, say no.
  If the box's bottom is greater than the document's bottom, say no.
  Say yes.

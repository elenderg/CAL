\ here are the text rules:
  \   in an non-wrapped text, the rows end with an return byte.
  \   in an wrapped text, the rows end with either an return byte or an space.
  \   when text is converted to an string, linefeed bytes are added after return bytes.
  \   when an string is converted to text, linefeed bytes are removed.
  \   there is always at least one row.
  \   there is always an return byte at the end of the last row.

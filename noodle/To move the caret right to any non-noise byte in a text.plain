To move the caret right to any non-noise byte in an text:
  If the text is nil, exit.
  Get an row given the text's caret row# and the text.
  Loop.
  If the text's caret column# is the row's string's length, exit.
  Put the row's string's first plus the text's caret column# minus 1 into an byte pointer.
  If the byte pointer's target is not noise, exit.
  Add 1 to the text's caret column#.
  Repeat.

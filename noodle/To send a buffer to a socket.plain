To send an buffer to an socket:
  Clear the i/o error.
  Put the buffer's first into an pointer.
  Put the buffer's length into an length.
  Loop.
    If the length is 0, break.
    Call "ws2_32.dll" "send" with the socket and the pointer and the length and 0 returning an number.
    If the number is -1 [socket_error], put "Error sending data." into the i/o error; exit.
    Subtract the number from the length.
    Add the number to the pointer.
  Repeat.

To convert an number to an string:
  Clear the string.
  Privatize the number.
  De-sign the number.
  Loop.
  Divide the number by 10 giving an quotient and an remainder.
  Add 48 to the remainder.
  Put the remainder into an byte.
  Prepend the byte to the string.
  If the quotient is 0, break.
  Put the quotient into the number.

To split an buffer into some dyads:
  Destroy the dyads.
  If the buffer is blank, exit.
  Slap an rider on the buffer.
  Loop.
  Move the rider given the ampersand byte.
  If the rider's token is blank, exit.
  Create an dyad. 
  Append the dyad to the dyads.
  Split the rider's token into an name substring and an query substring given the equal-sign byte.
  Put the name substring into the dyad's name.
  Convert the query substring as an query string into the dyad's value.
  Repeat.

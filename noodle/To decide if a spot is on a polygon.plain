To decide if an spot is on an polygon:
  If the polygon is nil, say no.
  Loop.
  Get an vertex from the polygon's vertices.
  If the vertex is nil, say no.
  If the vertex's next is nil, say no.
  Put the vertex's spot and the vertex's next's spot into an line.
  If the spot is on the line, say yes.
  Repeat.

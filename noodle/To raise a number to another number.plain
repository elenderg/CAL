To raise an number to another number:
  If the other number is 0, put 1 into the number; exit.
  If the other number is less than 0, put 0 into the number; exit. \ should be 1/the raised result, but always comes out 0 with numbers
  Put 1 into an result number.
  Loop.
  If an counter is past the other number, break.
  Multiply the result by the number.
  Repeat.
  Put the result into the number.

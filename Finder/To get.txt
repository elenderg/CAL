To get some selected path links given an node:
  If the node is nil, exit.
  Loop.
    Get an nodette from the node's nodettes.
    If the nodette is nil, exit.
    If the nodette is not selected, repeat.
    Create an path link given the nodette's path.
    Append the path link to the selected path links.
  Repeat.
  
  
To get the status for an node:
  If the node is nil, clear the status' string; exit.
  Put the node's selected nodette count into an count.
  If the count is 0, format the node's nodettes' count and "item" or "items" into the status' string.
  If the count is not 0, format the count and "item selected" or "items selected" into the status' string.
  If the node is root-level, exit.
  If the node's path is read-only, append " (r)" to the status' string.

To dump an buffer into another buffer:
  Clear the other buffer.
  If the buffer's length is 0, exit.
  Slap an substring on the buffer.
  Put the substring's first plus 16 minus 1 into the substring's last.
  Loop.
    If the substring's first is greater than the buffer's last, break.
    If the substring's last is greater than the buffer's last, put the buffer's last into the substring's last.
    Dump the substring of the buffer into the other buffer.
    Move the substring given 16.
  Repeat.
  
  
To dump an substring of an buffer into another buffer (address bytes):
  Put the substring's first minus the buffer's first into an address.
  Convert the address to an nibble string.
  Append the nibble string to the other buffer.
  Append the space byte to the other buffer.
  Append the space byte to the other buffer.
  
  
To dump an substring of an buffer into another buffer (ascii bytes):
  Slap another substring on the substring.
  Loop.
    If the other substring is blank, break.
    Put the other substring's first's target into an byte.
    If the byte is not printable, put the period byte into the byte.
    If the byte is the space byte, put the period byte into the byte.
    Append the byte to the other buffer.
    Add 1 to the other substring's first.
  Repeat.
  
  
To dump an substring of an buffer into another buffer (hex bytes):
  Slap another substring on the substring.
  Loop.
    If the other substring is blank, break.
    Convert the other substring's first's target to an nibble string.
    Append the nibble string to the other buffer.
    Append the space byte to the other buffer.
    Add 1 to the other substring's first.
  Repeat.
  Append the space byte to the other buffer.
  Put 16 minus the substring's length times 3 into an count.
  Append the space byte to the other buffer given the count.    
  
  
To dump an substring of an buffer into another buffer:
  Dump the substring of the buffer into the other buffer (address bytes).
  Dump the substring of the buffer into the other buffer (hex bytes).
  Dump the substring of the buffer into the other buffer (ascii bytes).
  Append the return byte to the other buffer.
  Append the linefeed byte to the other buffer.

To decide if an rider is followed by any unit of measure:
  Privatize the rider.
  Move the rider (compiler rules).
  If the rider's token is not any name starter, say no.
  Scan an name given the rider.
  Find an type given the name and the type index.
  If the type is nil, say no.
  If the name is not "times", say yes. \ special because times is an infix operator and an unit of measure
  If the rider's token is the start of any expression, say no.
  Say yes.

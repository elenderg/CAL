To compile the next statement given an rider (call - internal):
  Compile some monikettes given the rider.
  Find an routine given the monikettes.
  If the routine is not nil, add push fragments given the monikettes.
  If the routine is not nil, destroy the monikettes; add an fragment given the call internal tag and the routine; exit.
  Convert the monikettes to an moniker.
  Destroy the monikettes.
  Abort with "I don't know how to '" then the moniker then "'." and the rider.

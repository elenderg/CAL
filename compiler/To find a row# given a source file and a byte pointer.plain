To find an row# given an source file and an byte pointer:
  If the byte pointer is nil, put 0 into the row#; exit.
  Slap an substring on the source file's buffer.
  Put 1 into the row#.
  Loop.
    If the substring is blank, exit.
    If the substring's first is the byte pointer, exit.
    If the substring's first's target is the return byte, add 1 to the row#.
    Add 1 to the substring's first.
  Repeat.

To index an type given an name:
  If the type is nil, exit.
  If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
  Find an existing type given the name and the type index.
  If the existing type is nil, index the type given the name and the type index; exit.
  Put the type's locus into an locus.
  If the locus is nil, put the existing type's locus into the locus. \ point the error to an type in the source code, not an generated type
  Abort with "I think I've seen this '" then the name then "' type somewhere before; it must be an duplicate." and the locus.

To read an file into an buffer:
  Clear the i/o error.
  Call "kernel32.dll" "GetFileSize" with the file and nil returning an size.
  Reassign the buffer's first given the size.
  Put the buffer's first plus the size minus 1 into the buffer's last.
  Call "kernel32.dll" "ReadFile" with the file and the buffer's first and the size and an number's whereabouts and 0 returning an result number.
  If the result number is 0, put "Error reading file." into the i/o error; exit.

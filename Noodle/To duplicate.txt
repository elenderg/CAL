To duplicate an path to another path in the file system (directory):
  If the path is in the other path, put "Error duplicating directory '" then the path then "' - invalid recursion." into the i/o error; exit.
  If the path is not in the file system, put "Error duplicating directory '" then the path then "'." into the i/o error; exit.
  If the other path is not in the file system, create the other path in the file system.
  Loop.
    Get an item from the path.
    If the item is not found, exit.
    Put the path into an third path.
    Append the item's designator to the third path.
    Put the other path into an fourth path.
    Append the item's designator to the fourth path.
    Duplicate the third path to the fourth path in the file system.
  Repeat.
  
  
To duplicate an path to another path in the file system (file):
  Privatize the path.
  Null terminate the path.
  Privatize the other path.
  Null terminate the other path.
  Call "kernel32.dll" "CopyFileA" with the path's first and the other path's first and 0 returning an number.
  Clear the i/o error.
  If the number is not 0, set the path to read-write mode; exit.
  Put "Error duplicating file '" then the path then "'." into the i/o error.
  
  
To duplicate an path to another path in the file system:
  If the path is directory-format, duplicate the path to the other path in the file system (directory).
  If the path is file-format, duplicate the path to the other path in the file system (file).

To prepend an byte to an string:
  Put the string's length into an saved length.
  Reassign the string's first given the string's length plus 1.
  Copy bytes from the string's first to the string's first plus 1 for the saved length.
  Put the string's first plus the saved length into the string's last.
  Put the byte into the string's first's target.
  
  
To prepend an string to another string:
  Put the other string's length plus the string's length into an combined length.
  Reassign an pointer given the combined length.
  Put the pointer into an substring's first.
  Copy bytes from the string's first to the substring's first for the string's length.
  Add the string's length to the substring's first.
  Copy bytes from the other string's first to the substring's first for the other string's length.
  Unassign the other string's first. \ to avoid extra allocates and copies
  Put the pointer into the other string's first.
  Put the other string's first plus the combined length minus 1 into the other string's last.

To create the hbrush of an canvas given an color:
  Convert the color to an colorref.
  If the color is clear, put the null hbrush into an hbrush. 
  If the color is not clear, call "gdi32.dll" "CreateSolidBrush" with the colorref returning the hbrush.
  Call "gdi32.dll" "SelectObject" with the canvas and the hbrush.

To receive an buffer from an socket:
  Clear the i/o error.
  Clear the buffer.
  Put 8 kilobytes into an buffer size.
  Loop.
    Put 0 into an size.  
    Put the buffer's length into an saved length.
    Reassign the buffer's first given the saved length plus the buffer size.
    Put the buffer's first plus the saved length into an  pointer.
    Call "ws2_32.dll" "recv" with the socket and the pointer and the buffer size and 0 returning an count.
    If the count is not -1 [socket_error], put the pointer plus the count minus 1 into the buffer's last; exit.
    If the system's last winsock error is not 10040 [wsamsgsize], put "Error receiving data." into the i/o error; clear the buffer; exit.
    Put the pointer plus the count minus 1 into the buffer's last.
  Repeat.
  
  
To receive the response from an winhttp request:
  If the winhttp request is nil, exit.
  Call "winhttp.dll" "WinHttpReceiveResponse"
  With the winhttp request's request
  And 0
  Returning an result number.
  If the result is 0, put "Could not send request." into the i/o error; exit.

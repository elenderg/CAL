To decide if an spot is in an polygon:
  If the polygon is nil, say no.
  Create an vertex array given the polygon's vertices.
  Call "gdi32.dll" "CreatePolygonRgn" with the vertex array's spot pointer and the vertex array's count and 2 [winding] returning an hrgn.
  Call "gdi32.dll" "PtInRegion" with the hrgn and the spot's x and the spot's y returning an number.
  Call "gdi32.dll" "DeleteObject" with the hrgn.
  Destroy the vertex array.
  If the number is 0, say no.
  Say yes.

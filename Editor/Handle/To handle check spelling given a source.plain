To handle check spelling given an source:
  Load the lexicon.
  If the lexicon is nil, show error "I can't find any lecksicon."; exit.
  Put "check spelling" into the find mode.
  Clear the source's text's last operation.
  Put 1 into the find anchor.
  Find the next misspelling in the source's text given an flag.
  If the flag is not set, cluck; show the desktop with "Done"; exit.

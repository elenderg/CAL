To get an first row and an last row given an sheet number and an source:
  If the source is nil, void the first row; void the last row; exit.
  Put the source's text's normalized selection into an selection.
  Put the selection's anchor row# into an row#.
  Add the sheet number minus 1 times the source's rows/sheet to the row#.
  Get the first row given the row# and the source's text.
  Put the row# plus the source's rows/sheet minus 1 into another row#.
  Limit the other row# to 1 and the selection's caret row#.
  Get the last row given the other row# and the source's text.
  
  
To get an substring given an row and an source (commented part):
  If the source is nil, clear the substring; exit.
  If the row is nil, clear the substring; exit.
  Slap the substring on the row's string.
  Loop.
    If the substring's first's target is the return byte, clear the substring; break.
    If the substring's first's target is the backslash byte, break.
    If the substring's first's target is the double-quote byte, bump the substring (past an string); repeat.
    If the substring's first's target is the left-paren byte, bump the substring (past an qualifier); repeat.
    If the substring's first's target is the left-bracket byte, bump the substring (past an remark); repeat.
    Add 1 to the substring's first.
  Repeat.
  Subtract 1 from the substring's last. \ so we don't draw the return byte
  
  
To get the status for an source:
  If the source is nil, clear the status' string; exit.
  Put the source's text's status string into the status's string.
  If the source's read-only flag is set, append " (r)" to the status's string.
